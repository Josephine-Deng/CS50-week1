# What I Did
This project is part of the CS50x coursework. I wrote three small programs using the C programming language, applying fundamental concepts such as user input, loops, and output formatting.

# Technologies Used
-C language (with cs50.h and stdio.h)
-Visual Studio Code
-Git & GitHub for version control

# Project Description
This repository includes the following programs:
-cat.c
A simple program that prompts the user for a number and then prints "meow" that many times. It demonstrates the use of get_int() from the CS50 library and a custom function with a for loop.
-mario_less.c
Generates a left-aligned pyramid pattern using # symbols, inspired by the game Super Mario. The height of the pyramid is determined by user input.
-mario_more.c
An extended version of mario_less.c. It creates two mirrored pyramids separated by two spaces, reinforcing understanding of nested loops and pattern printing.

# What I Learned
-How to call and define functions in C
-How to use built-in functions from cs50.h and stdio.h
-The syntax and logic of for loops and how they control program flow
-How to structure code using main and helper functions
-How to build simple patterns and structures with nested loops

# Project Files
-cat.c
-mario_less.c
-mario_more.c

# Next Steps
-Continue with CS50 Week 3: Algorithms
-Complete the final problem of CS50 Week 1
-Practice and enhance C programming skills through more complex tasks
